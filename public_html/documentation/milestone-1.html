<b>Persona</b>: Shawn is happy-go-lucky and enjoys the small funky things in life<br>
Her mantra is, "Love the things that are tragically beautiful and beautifully tragic."<br>
In here eyes form always out weighs the value of function.  Because of this here home and<br>
personal spaces are always decorated with small meaningful items.  At the root of it she <br>
just loves collecting.  In here efforts to acquire new items she relies on the hands-on approach<br>
and frequents garage/yard sales, flea markets, and knick-knack shops.  Because she often does not<br>
know what she is looking for she prefers a general browsing approach and the social reward <br>
of face to face contact.  After  all friends where just strangers at one time.<br>
<br>
<b>Technology in Shawn's life</b>:  Although she is an avid email user, she rarely uses the internet for<br>
other purposes due to how impersonal and voyeuristic it makes her feel.  She only has a flip-phone <br>
and an old I-Mac single unit computer.<br>
<br>
<b>Challenge:</b> Create a super 'simple' website that allows users to interact with the Zorka myth and narrative
while agitating the desire to collect, share, and create stories as unique as each Zorka.
